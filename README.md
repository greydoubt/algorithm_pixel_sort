# algorithm_pixel_sort
C++ and Python that pixel sorts a PNG or JPEG image

C++: To compile this code, you'll need to install the OpenCV library and include its header files and libraries in your build system. The above code assumes that you're using OpenCV 4.x. If you're using a different version of OpenCV, you may need to modify some of the function calls or constants.

Python: To run this code, you'll need to install the Pillow library using pip. This code assumes that the input image is in JPEG format, but you can also use this code for PNG images by changing the file extensions in the input and output filenames.

TO DO:

GUI mode (preview in Tkinter or Qt and modify parameters "live" as well as save parameter patches for later)
